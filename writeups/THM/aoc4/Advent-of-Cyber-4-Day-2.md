By typing `ls`, we can see 2 files: `SSHD.log` and `webserver.log`

Answer: `2`

### Question 3

> Elf McSkidy managed to capture the logs generated by the web server. What is the name of this log file?

Answer: `webserver.log`

### Question 4

> Begin investigating the log file from question #3 to answer the following questions.

Answer: `No answer needed`

### Question 5

> On what day was Santa's naughty and nice list stolen?

If we just use the `more webserver.log` command, we can see the contents of the log.
`head webserver.log` would have worked too, and printed the first 10 lines of the file

One date is prevalent: `18/Nov/2022`. If we look at a calendar, that was a Friday.

Answer: `Friday`

### Question 6

> What is the IP address of the attacker?

At the same line as the question above, we can see an IP address.

Answer: `10.10.249.191`

### Question 7

> What is the name of the important list that the attacker stole from Santa?

For this one we can simply use `grep` with a special string that works for `200 OK` status codes (ie. the server succeeded in returning some content).

Command: `grep " 200 " webserver.log`

Why the space? Because otherwise we'll get all of the endpoints with the number `200` in them, and we don't want that.

Answer: `santaslist.txt`

### Question 8

> Look through the log files for the flag. The format of the flag is: `THM{}`

Here we can just `grep` for the flag format, like so: `grep "THM{" *.log`

Answer: `THM{STOLENSANTASLIST}`
